# Trash Master

Trash master is an app that allows citizens to register their trash can to our database in firebase. This would allow users
to schedule a specific pickup date for their trash, report their trash can if it is stolen, report a missed trash pickup,
report trash on their street, and finally, track the garbage truck and how far away it is from their house!
